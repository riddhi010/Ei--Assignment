# EI-Assignment: Design Patterns

This repository contains solutions for the **EI (Educational Initiatives) Assignment**. The assignment is divided into **two exercises**:

1. **Exercise 1**: Implementation of core **Design Patterns** in Java.
2. **Exercise 2**: A terminal-based **Virtual Classroom Manager** application.

Both exercises follow **industry best practices**, including **SOLID principles, logging, exception handling, defensive programming, and optimized performance**.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+ installed
- IntelliJ IDEA 
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd EI-Assignment
```

### Step 2: Open in IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)
- Open IntelliJ IDEA.
- Choose **Open** and select the `EI-Assignment` folder.
- Ensure the `src` folder is marked as **Sources Root**:
  - Right-click on `src` → **Mark Directory as** → **Sources Root**.

### Step 3: Build the Project
- IntelliJ will automatically build the project.
- If it doesn't, manually build using: **Build > Build Project**.

### Step 4: Run Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Design Patterns

- Right-click the file → **Run 'Main'**.
-  See [`src/exercise1/README.md`](src/exercise1/README.md) for detailed instructions on running each pattern, available use cases, and interaction guide.

#### Exercise 2: Virtual Classroom Manager
- Navigate to `exercise2.virtualclassroom.Main`.
- Right-click → **Run 'Main'**.
-  See [`src/exercise2/README.md`](src/exercise2/README.md) for detailed instructions on running the terminal-based classroom manager, commands, and features.

## Gold Standards Followed

- **Logging** using Java `Logger`
- **Exception handling** and **transient error handling**
- **Input validations** at all levels
- **Defensive programming**
- **Optimized and maintainable code**
- Added **colorful console notifications**
