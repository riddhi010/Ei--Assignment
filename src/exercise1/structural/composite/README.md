# Composite Pattern

## Overview
**Type:** Structural Pattern  

The Composite Pattern is used to **treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly**.  
It allows you to build a tree-like structure where clients can interact with **both single objects (leaf) and groups of objects (composite)** through the same interface.

## **Use Case Demonstrated:** Course Management  

**Scenario:**  
A course contains multiple modules, and each module contains multiple lessons.  
Using the Composite pattern allows the system to **manage courses, modules, and lessons uniformly**, making it easy to display the course hierarchy or add/remove modules and lessons dynamically.
