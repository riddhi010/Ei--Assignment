# Factory Pattern

## Overview
**Type:** Creational Pattern  

The Factory Pattern is used to **create objects without exposing the instantiation logic** to the client.  
It provides a common interface for creating different types of objects based on input or configuration.

## **Use Case Demonstrated:** Document Generator  

**Scenario:**  
A user can generate different types of documents (PDF, Word, Excel) through a single interface.  
The client doesn’t need to know how each document type is created — the **factory handles object creation**.
